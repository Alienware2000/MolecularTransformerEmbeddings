The dataset files are too large to include in this repository or GitHub's releases.
H5py binary files for each dataset are available from this public Google Drive link:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mJZPlFaStmsuwnpGVlpwJ7XL9Di_6j5u?usp=sharing

hiv1_protease_2.hdf5 is ~3Gb (easiest to use).
The 652067 and 1053197 assay files are ~200Gb.

Download the h5py binary files for each dataset and place them in this folder (embedding_binaries).

If this download is inconvenient or the link is down, use the build_embedding_binaries.ipynb notebook and the dataset TSV files in the binding_datasets folder to generate the binaries on your own machine.
