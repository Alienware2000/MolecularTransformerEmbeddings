# MolecularTransformerEmbeddings
Code for the Transformer neural network trained to translate between molecular text representations and create molecular embeddings.

The Encoder of the Transformer network can convert a SMILES string of length M into an MxN matrix, where N is the size of the embedding vectors used for each SMILES string character. Pretrained weights from a network trained on 83,000,000+ molecules are provided so useful embeddings can be obtained.
